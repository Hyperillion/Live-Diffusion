# Live-Diffusion-ComfyUI
The project live-diffusion desires to develop a pioneering real-time interactive AI-generated image system, leveraging sensor data and a user-friendly interface to promote AI technology for creative expression. By utilizing inputs like camera and sensor data, our system will become highly responsive to user interactions, enhancing the dynamism of AI-generated image outputs. At the same time, we are dedicated to making AI image generation accessible to the wider creator by demystifying technical terms with clear, simple language in an intuitive user interface. Our ultimate target is to foster an inclusive approach combined with TouchDesigner and ComfyUI that encourages broad participation in AI-generative creation, making AI-powered creativity a dynamic and intuitive experience.
